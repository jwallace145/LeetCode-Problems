# Symmetric Tree

## Problem Statement
Given the root of a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself or not (i.e. symmetric around the center of the binary tree).

## Constraints
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 1000]`
- The possible value of the node is in the range `[-100, 100]`

## Time Complexity

## Space Complexity
